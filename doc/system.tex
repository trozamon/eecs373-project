\section{Power}
Power is provided by a bank of capacitors, charged by a solar cell. For the
purposes of planning, the following characteristics are assumed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 66mW Power Draw: Nordic MCU + BLE Combo (33mW) and miscellaneous
        other power draws
    \item 10uA solar cell current
    \item 100ms runtime
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Maths}
Assuming 66mWs, or $6.6\cdot10^{-3}$J, of energy are needed to take a
measurement and send it, the amount of capacitance is given by: \begin{align*}
    U & = \frac{1}{2}CV^2\\
    1.32 \cdot 10^{-2} & = CV^2
\end{align*}

With 3V storage, this is roughly 1.4mF, and with a higher voltage like 6V,
roughly 530uF.

The charging time can be found by manipulating the standard capacitor equation
thingy: \begin{align*}
    i & = C\frac{dv}{dt}\\
    it & = Cv\\
    t & = \frac{Cv}{i}
\end{align*}

With 6V storage, initial charging time is roughly 315 seconds. Secondary
charging time is roughly half that. With 3V storage, charge time is roughly 420
seconds always, since always charging from 0V.
